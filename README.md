## Components

* **Frontend:** The frontend of our Dapp offers an intuitive interface for users to manage their supply chains efficiently, with seamless integration of Metamask for secure transactions.
* **BitLogix Smart Contract:** The BitLogix core smart contract manages registration, product creation, payment automation, and token rewards.
* **BitLogixNFT Smart Contract:** A specialized smart contract that allows enterprises to mint and transfer NFTs as reward to recipient associated with products for maintaining quality of product leads to enhancing quality control.
* **Metamask:** Metamask, a popular Ethereum wallet extension, is seamlessly integrated to facilitate secure transactions, account management, and interactions with the BitTorrent chain.
* **Backend:** BitLogix's backend infrastructure supports data management and decentralized file storage.
* **MongoDB:** A scalable and flexible NoSQL database that stores essential data related to user accounts, product details, and transaction history.
* **IPFS:** A distributed file system for storing and retrieving large files and IPFS URIs associated with NFTs. IPFS ensures data availability and reliability while reducing centralized data dependencies.

# Smart contract Documentation

BitLogix relies on two essential smart contracts deployed on the BitTorrent chain:

* **BitLogix Smart Contract**
* **BitLogixNFT Smart Contract** 

## BitLogix Smart Contract

The BitLogix Smart Contract serves as the backbone of our supply chain management DApp. It manages user registration, product creation, payment automation, and token rewards.

**Functions**

```
registerEntity(string memory name, string memory businessDetails, string memory govAuthorizedID) external
```
* Allows enterprises to register within the BitLogix ecosystem.

```
registerRecipient(string memory name, string memory placeOfBusiness, string memory govAuthorizedID) external
```
* Allows recipients to register within the BitLogix ecosystem.

```
claimTokens() external
```
* Enables registered entities and recipients to claim tokens as a one-time reward.

```
deposit() external payable
```

* Lets users deposit BTT tokens into the contract.

```
createProduct(string memory name, uint256 Price, uint256 quantity, string memory pickupPlace, string memory destinationPlace, address recipientAddress) external
```
* Allows registered enterprises to create products for delivery, automating payment and product tracking.

```
confirmReceipt(address entityAddress, uint256 productIndex) external
```
* Allows recipients to confirm product receipt and release payment to the enterprise.

```
getContractBalance() external view returns (uint256)
```
* Allows users to check the token balance of the contract.

```
withdrawPlatformFees() external
```
* Lets the contract owner withdraw platform fees.

## BitLogixNFT Smart Contract

The BitLogixNFT Smart Contract enhances quality control within BitLogix. It allows enterprises to mint and transfer NFTs associated with products.

**Functions**

```
function mintNFT(address to, string memory ipfsURI) public
```
* To mint a new NFT with an associated IPFS URI, call the mintNFT function

```
function setBaseURI(string memory newBaseURI) public
```
* The setBaseURI function allows you to update the base URI used for NFT metadata. 

```
tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view override returns (string memory)
```
* Retrieves token-specific URIs for NFTs.

**Transferring NFTs**

You can transfer NFTs between addresses using standard ERC721 transfer functions such as 'transferFrom' and 'safeTransferFrom'.

**Contract Structure**

BitLogixNFT is an ERC721 contract that extends the OpenZeppelin ERC721 and Ownable contracts.

# Troubleshooting

* **Metamask Connectivity Issues**

If you're experiencing difficulties connecting Metamask to the BitTorrent network, start by ensuring that your internet connection is stable. Additionally, check whether you are on the correct network which is BitTorrent Chain Donau. Sometimes, simply switching networks can resolve connectivity problems.

* **Registration Problems**

If you encounter obstacles during the registration process, it's important to verify that you meet the registration criteria and provide accurate information. Make sure your Metamask account is unlocked to complete the registration successfully. If issues persist, consider refreshing the registration page and attempting the process again.

* **Token Reward Challenges**

If you are unable to claim tokens or face issues with token rewards, start by confirming your registration status. Token rewards are typically a one-time claim, so ensure that you haven't already claimed them. To confirm receipt, check your wallet balance to see if the tokens have been credited.

* **Product Management Issues**

For problems related to creating products, confirming receipt, or tracking products, it's essential to check your registration status. Only registered entities and recipients can access these features. Ensure that you have correctly entered product details and review your Metamask transactions for any errors or pending transactions.

* **Quality Control and NFTs**

If you are encountering problems with quality control, NFT issuance, or communication with the Person-in-Charge, first, make use of the provided contact information to reach out directly. Ensure that you possess the necessary permissions to control product quality and issue NFTs within the BitLogix ecosystem.
